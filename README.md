# Facial-Expression-Recognition-System
Image Processing

This facial expression recognition software which can detect a person facial expression and based on which it will display weather the person is smiling, sad or shocked.
    This software system is designed to first detect and read a person face. Then the system computes various facial parameters of the persons face.
     Upon detecting and registering these parameters, the system compares these parameters with default expressions for human sadness, smile and other human expressions. Based on these statistics our system concludes the person’s emotional state.

Facial recognition system works as follows:
1.	Upload picture find its gray scale values, height of eye, lips and other values.

2. Register persons face in the database.

3. Find person’s name and other detail by searching the detail detected in the above steps through the database.

4. Find that particular persons face expression and emotional state by searching the detail detected in the above steps through the database. 

Our system will recognise one of the following emotional state
•	Anger: Involves three main features – Teeth revealing, eyebrows down and inner side tightening, squinting eyes.
•	Disgust: involves wrinkled nose and mouth. Sometimes even involves tongue coming out.      
•	Fear: involves widened eyes and sometime open mouth.
•	Surprise: very similar to the expression of fear.
•	Sadness: involves a slight pulling down of lip corners, inner side of eyebrows is rising.

This task is an attempt to recognize facial fea-tures using MATLAB software program that may detect someone facial features based totally on which it will display whether or not the per-son is smiling, unhappy, shocked, surprised, etc. This software program system is designed to first stumble on and examine a person face. Then the device computes diverse facial param-eters of the individuals face. Upon detecting and registering these parameters, the machine com-pares these parameters with default expressions for human sadness, smile and other human ex-pressions. Primarily based on those records our system concludes the person’s emotional state.
